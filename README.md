# Web-Scraper

Using Cheerio and Mongoose the user can scrape articles from the Idaho Statesman's website.  See what the top headlines for the Spud State are!

The page is built using Bootstrap, Handlebars, Express and Javascript

Things to be completed at a later date:
 - Store saved articles to the Mongo DB 
 - Allow the user to make notes about the article
 - Allow other users to read the notes made about all of the articles
